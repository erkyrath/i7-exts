Version 2/151019 of Unified Glulx Input (for Glulx only) by Andrew Plotkin begins here.

[### To do: (rough order of importance)
- should setting-up-input be generalized? moved into AwaitInput?
- should event/buffer info linger after the rulebooks run? would simplify code that calls AwaitInput, and also you could see more stuff at after-reading time
- rationalize UNDO and OOPS handling
- noecho flag and whatever it enables
- write more examples (see todo notes)
- status-window support
- REPLAY support
- add the discardundo model
]

Chapter - Constants and Variables

Section - Basic Types

Use pass blank input lines translates as (- Constant PASS_BLANK_INPUT_LINES; -). 

[Input-contexts allow us to organize the rulebooks described in this extension. Every time the game stops to await input, it does so in an input context.]

An input-context is a kind of value. The input-contexts are primary context, disambiguation context, yes-no question context, extended yes-no question context, repeat yes-no question context, final question context, keystroke-wait context.

Definition: an input-context is command if it is primary context or it is disambiguation context.
Definition: an input-context is yes-no if it is yes-no question context or it is extended yes-no question context or it is repeat yes-no question context.

[We need a proxy object for each Glk window. Currently we just define two. (This extension is not yet compatible with Multiple Windows.)]

A glk-window is a kind of object.
The story-window is a glk-window.
The status-window is a glk-window.

[When setting up input (in a particular context), the game indicates which input requests each window should make. These are the input-request and hyperlink-input-request properties.]

A text-input-mode is a kind of value. The text-input-modes are no-input, char-input, line-input.
A glk-window has a text-input-mode called the input-request.
A glk-window has a text called the preload-input-text.
A glk-window can be hyperlink-input-request.
A glk-window can be mouse-input-request.

[Timer input is global -- not attached to any window. The timer-request variable is in milliseconds, or 0 for no timer events.]

The timer-request is a number that varies. The timer-request is 0.

[These I6 properties are used internally by the library to track whether specific Glk requests have been made or fulfilled. The game should never touch these.]

Include (-
	with current_input_request (+ no-input +), ! of type text-input-mode
	with current_hyperlink_request false,      ! true or false
	with current_mouse_request false,          ! true or false
-) when defining a glk-window.

Include (-
! Milliseconds, or 0 for no timer events.
Global current_timer_request = 0;
-) after "Variables and Arrays" in "Glulx.i6t";

[These values match up to evtype_Timer, evtype_CharInput, etc because they are defined in the same order.]
A g-event is a kind of value. The g-events are timer-event, char-event, line-event, mouse-event, arrange-event, redraw-event, sound-notify-event, and hyperlink-event.

To decide which g-event is null-event: (- 0 -)

To say hyperlink (O - object): (- if (glk_gestalt(gestalt_Hyperlinks, 0)) { glk_set_hyperlink({O}); } -).
To say hyperlink (N - number): (- if (glk_gestalt(gestalt_Hyperlinks, 0)) { glk_set_hyperlink({N}); } -).
To say /hyperlink: (- if (glk_gestalt(gestalt_Hyperlinks, 0)) { glk_set_hyperlink(0); } -).


Section - A Few Globals

[These event structures are now used in parallel with the buffer and parse arrays. For example, we'll call ParserInput(context, inputevent, buffer, parse) or ParserInput(context, inputevent2, buffer2, parse2).]

Include (-
Array inputevent --> 4;
Array inputevent2 --> 4;
-) after "Variables and Arrays" in "Glulx.i6t";

[Indicates whether the parser_results has been filled in by ParserInput (and thus we need no text parsing).]

Include (-
Global parser_results_set;
-) after "Global Variables" in "Output.i6t";


Section - Input Rulebook Data

[Globals used within the accepting input and handling input rulebooks. (Logically, these could be rulebook variables, but that turns out to be awkward. In several ways.)]

Include (-
! Array contains: a_event, a_buffer, a_table
Constant INPUT_RULEBOOK_SIZE 5;
Constant IRDAT_RB_CURRENT 0;
Constant IRDAT_EVENT 1;
Constant IRDAT_BUFFER 2;
Constant IRDAT_TABLE 3;
Constant IRDAT_NEEDPROMPT 4;
Array input_rulebook_data --> INPUT_RULEBOOK_SIZE;
-) after "Variables and Arrays" in "Glulx.i6t";

Include (-
[ InputRDataInit rb a_event a_buffer a_table;
	input_rulebook_data-->IRDAT_RB_CURRENT = rb;
	input_rulebook_data-->IRDAT_EVENT = a_event;
	input_rulebook_data-->IRDAT_BUFFER = a_buffer;
	input_rulebook_data-->IRDAT_TABLE = a_table;
	input_rulebook_data-->IRDAT_NEEDPROMPT = false;
];

[ InputRDataFinal;
	input_rulebook_data-->IRDAT_RB_CURRENT = 0;
	input_rulebook_data-->IRDAT_EVENT = 0;
	input_rulebook_data-->IRDAT_BUFFER = 0;
	input_rulebook_data-->IRDAT_TABLE = 0;
	input_rulebook_data-->IRDAT_NEEDPROMPT = false;
];
-).

[Some phrases for use in the accepting input and handling input rulebooks. Do not try to use them anywhere else!]

To decide what g-event is the/-- current input event type: (- InputRDataEvType() -).
To decide whether handling (E - g-event): (- InputRDataEvTypeIs({E}) -).

! In the interests of sanity, we don't try to handle actions which include text (topics). These are really only useful when parsing player-typed commands, and the whole point of this routine is to bypass textual input.

Chapter - New Rulebooks

Section - Setting Up Input

[This rulebook sets up the input requests for parser input (the command contexts, not the yes-or-no or final questions). It is called at the top of the ParserInput loop.]
The setting up input rules are an input-context based rulebook.

[This is called by every context that sets up requests for AwaitInput. (The start of the setting up input rulebook, and also YesOrNo and other such contexts.)]
To clear all input requests (this is all-input-request-clearing):
	clear input requests for the story-window;
	clear input requests for the status-window.
	[We do not clear timer-request. That will run in the background as turns (and other inputs) go by.]

[Clear input requests for a given window.]
To clear input requests for (W - glk-window):
	now the input-request of W is no-input;
	now W is not hyperlink-input-request.
	[We do not clear the preload-input-text variable! By default, we want interrupted input to carry over from turn to turn. Of course you could add a setting-up-input rule to clear it.]

To set the/-- timer to (N - number) ms/millisec/millisecond/milliseconds:
	now timer-request is N.
To set the/-- timer to (R - real number) sec/second/seconds:
	let N be (R * 1000.0) to the nearest whole number;
	now timer-request is N.
To set/turn the/-- timer off:
	now timer-request is 0.

To decide whether the timer is active:
	if timer-request is not zero, decide yes.
To decide whether the timer is inactive:
	if timer-request is zero, decide yes.

[A flag for whether "set input undoable" has been used during the current ParserInput call. It has no meaning outside ParserInput.]
The setting-up-input-undoability-flag is a truth state that varies.

To set the/-- input undoable:
	now setting-up-input-undoability-flag is true.
To set the/-- input not undoable:
	now setting-up-input-undoability-flag is false.
To set the/-- input nonundoable/non-undoable:
	now setting-up-input-undoability-flag is false.

First setting up input rule (this is the initial clear input requests rule):
	set input non-undoable;
	clear all input requests.

Setting up input rule (this is the standard parser input line request rule):
	set input undoable;
	now the input-request of the story-window is line-input.


Section - Prompt Displaying

[This rulebook, as you might guess, is in charge of displaying the prompt before player input. Its parameter is an input-context, which distinguishes regular game input from other questions (yes-or-no, the final game question, etc).]
The prompt displaying rules are an input-context based rulebook.

[These globals are used by the extended yes-or-no system (YesOrNoPrompt). The classic YesOrNo does not use them.]
The extended yes-no prompt is a text that varies.
The repeat yes-no prompt is a text that varies.

[The default prompt rules are a bit complicated because we want to keep supporting the old prompt customization tools, which date from across Inform's history. For example, the default prompt rule displays the old "command prompt" global variable, which defaults to ">".]

Last prompt displaying rule for the keystroke-wait context (this is the keystroke-wait prompt rule):
	instead say "" (A).
Last prompt displaying rule for the yes-no question context (this is the yes-no question prompt rule):
	instead say ">" (A).
Last prompt displaying rule for the extended yes-no question context (this is the extended yes-no question prompt rule):
	instead say "[extended yes-no prompt] >" (A).
Last prompt displaying rule for the repeat yes-no question context (this is the repeat yes-no question prompt rule):
	instead say "[repeat yes-no prompt] >" (A).
Last prompt displaying rule for the final question context (this is the final question prompt rule):
	instead follow the print the final prompt rule.
Last prompt displaying rule for an input-context (this is the default prompt rule):
	[really truly last]
	instead say the command prompt.


Section - Accepting Input

The accepting input rules are an input-context based rulebook.

[Called in AwaitEvent. On success (acceptance), AwaitEvent returns the event. On no result or failure (rejection), AwaitEvent continues waiting.]

[Handy synonyms for "rule succeeds" and "rule fails".]
To accept the/-- input event: (- RulebookSucceeds(); rtrue; -).
To reject the/-- input event: (- RulebookFails(); rtrue; -).

[Same definition as in Basic Screen Effects.]
To update/redraw the/-- status line: (- DrawStatusLine(); -).

To interrupt text input for (W - glk-window), preserving input: (- InputRDataInterruptInput({W}, {phrase options}); -).

[Standard rules:]

Accepting input rule when handling arrange-event (this is the standard redraw status line on arrange rule):
	redraw the status line;
	reject input event.

Last accepting input rule (this is the standard accept all requested input rule):
	let T be the current input event type;
	if T is:
		-- line-event:
			if the input-request of the story-window is line-input:
				accept input event;
		-- char-event:
			if the input-request of the story-window is char-input:
				accept input event;
		-- hyperlink-event:
			if the story-window is hyperlink-input-request:
				accept input event;
	[This doesn't cover non-human-generated events like timer events.]
	reject input event.


Section - Checking Undo Input

The checking undo input rules are an input-context based rulebook.

To decide whether standard-undo-input-line: (- InputRDataEvLineIsUndo() -).

Checking undo input rule (this is the standard line input undo checking rule):
	if standard-undo-input-line:
		rule succeeds.


Section - Handling Input

The handling input rules are an input-context based rulebook.

[Called after (not within) any invocation of ParserInput. If a specific action is generated, that action is performed. On failure: no action is parsed or performed.]

[This rulebook is empty by default. On no result, the parser proceeds with its normal behavior: line input is parsed, other input is rejected with "I beg your pardon?"]


Chapter - Our Core Routines

Section - AwaitInput

Include (-

! AwaitInput: block and await an acceptable input. What "acceptable" means is customizable. Typically the caller will be interested in some event types (e.g., line input), will allow others to do their job (arrange events redrawing the status window), and will ignore the rest (keep awaiting input).
! This is the low-level entry point to the Glk input system; all input requests funnel down to this function. It sets up the Glk input request events and calls glk_select().
! This function also handles displaying the prompt and redrawing the status line. (Through customizable rulebooks and activities, of course.)
! AwaitInput takes four arguments: the input context, an event structure, a line input buffer, and a buffer for parsing words from line input. (The latter two arguments are optional; if not supplied then line input cannot be accepted. If a_buffer is supplied but a_table is not, then line input will be accepted but not tokenized.)

		a_buffer-->0 = 0;
	}
	if (a_table) {
		a_table-->0 = 0;
	}
	
	! In the old-fashioned YesOrNo sequence, we want to print the prompt after the caller's printed question, with no line break. In all other cases, we ensure a line break before the prompt.
	runonprompt = (incontext == (+ yes-no question context +) );

Unified Glulx Input ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Unified Glulx Input is an attempt to tidy up all the messy I6 APIs that you need to customize your game's input system. 

The Glulx Entry Points extension does this already, but that exposes all the mess -- you have to understand how Glk works to use to correctly. Unified Glulx Input tries to offer you a simple model which handles common cases easily.

(This extension was written and tested with Inform 7 release 6L38 only.)

Chapter: Basic concepts

Section: Input-contexts: why are we awaiting input?

A game can stop and await input for many reasons. It can be waiting for a command, or for a yes-or-no answer (an "if the player consents..." test). It can be waiting for the player to hit any key to continue.

In Unified Glulx Input, all of these inputs invoke the same mechanism. The mechanism can be customized to behave in different ways -- printing different prompts, waiting for different sorts of input. But it's always the same mechanism underneath.

You customize it by writing rules. The extension has five rulebooks which cover various aspects of the problem. The default rules cover the normal input situations of an IF game -- the ones mentioned above. Of course, you can modify these or add more.

We distinguish these situations with a value called an "input-context". The rulebooks we mentioned are input-context based rulebooks. The UGI extension comes with seven:

	primary context, disambiguation context (the command input-contexts)
	yes-no question context, extended yes-no question context, repeat yes-no question context (the yes-no input-contexts)
	final question context
	keystroke-wait context

The first two (primary and disambiguation) are used by the main game loop -- the core cycle of fetching and performing commands. The others are special-purpose, ad-hoc inputs.

These are more finely divided than you usually need to bother with. For example, the game might be waiting for a normal command (primary context) or for a disambiguation reply (disambiguation context). In most games these will appear the same. So you can handle them together. For example:

	Prompt displaying rule for a command input-context:
		instead say ">>>";

This rule changes the command prompt for all main-game-loop inputs (both primary and disambiguation).

Section: G-events: what kind of input are we awaiting?

Most IF input comes as lines of text. But a game can also accept keystroke input, as in a "hit any key" prompt or a menu controlled with arrow keys.

Glulx currently supports eight types of input, described as "g-event" values:

	char-event - a keystroke
	line-event - a line of text
	hyperlink-event - selection of a hyperlink
	timer-event - event repeated at fixed intervals
	mouse-event - a mouse click
	arrange-event - window sizes have changed
	redraw-event - graphics windows need redrawing
	sound-notify-event - sound finished playing

Section: Glk-windows: what window is awaiting input?

This version of UGI is only concerned with one window, the "story-window". You can set various properties of the story-window object to customize its behavior.

There is also a "status-window" object, but it is not yet functional. Future versions of UGI will support this. Future versions will also integrate with the Multiple Windows extension to support multi-window games.

Chapter: High-level tasks

These phrases can be used with no deeper knowledge of UGI.

Section: Yes-no questions

	if the player consents: ...

This works just as it always has (WWI 11.5); it waits for the player to type "yes" or "no". You are expected to print the question first.

	if the player consents asking (T1 - text): ...
	if the player consents asking (T1 - text) and (T2 - text): ...

Similar, except UGI uses your text as the prompt (through the magic of the prompt displaying rulebook). T1 should be the initial question; T2 is a followup if the player fails to answer. If you don't supply T2, it defaults to "Please answer yes or no."

Section: Waiting for a key

These phrases are copied from the Basic Screen Effects extension; they have been updated here to work with UGI.

	wait for any key
	wait for the SPACE key

By default no prompt is printed. You can print your own beforehand, or write a prompt displaying rule:

	Prompt displaying rule for keystroke-wait context:
		say ">>>";

If you want to cause a wait and then get the key that was hit:

	the key waited for -- Unicode character

Include the Unicode Character Names extension for a complete list of characters, or my ASCII Character Names extension for the basic ones. The result may also be a special value representing a control key:

	special keycode left, special keycode right, special keycode up, special keycode down, special keycode return, special keycode delete, special keycode escape, special keycode tab, special keycode pageup, special keycode pagedown, special keycode home, special keycode end, special keycode func1, ... special keycode func12

These are not part of the Unicode spec, but I7 represents them as Unicode character values. (They are outside the official Unicode range of $0 to $10FFFF.) Don't try to print them or insert them into normal texts -- they have no normal printed representation. If you need to print a special character, use this phrase:

	say extended (C - Unicode character)

This will print special characters as "left", "right", and so on. Normal Unicode characters will be printed directly.

Chapter: The five rulebooks

We've talked about the five rulebooks, and now it's time to introduce them:

	setting up input rules - decide what kinds of input are desired
	prompt displaying rules - display a prompt, traditionally ">"
	accepting input rules - accept, reject, or alter individual input events
	checking undo input rules - check whether an input event is an UNDO command
	handling input rules - convert an input event into an action

These rulebooks are based on an input-context value. So you might write

	Prompt displaying rule for yes-or-no context: ...
	Accepting input rule for a command input-context: ...

Section: Setting up input rules

This rulebook decides what sort of input the game desires for player commands. It also decides whether the command will be an undo step. By default it requests only line input, and says that all line inputs are undo steps.

This rulebook applies only to the command contexts (primary and disambiguation). Other questions (yes-or-no, keystroke-wait, etc) do their own setup (and are not undo steps).

To customize this, set the input-request, hyperlink-input-request, and mouse-input-request properties of the story-window object. For example:

	Setting up input rule:
		now the input-request of the story-window is char-input;
		now the story-window is hyperlink-input-request;

The input-request property can be char-input, line-input, or no-input. (These are mutually exclusive.) You can set hyperlink-input-request and mouse-input-request independently.

(Note that mouse-input-request does not apply to the story-window -- buffer windows have no fixed coordinates -- so it cannot currently be used. There is a status-window object, but UGI does not yet support input requests for it.)

To indicate whether this command is an undo step, use one of these phrases:

	set input undoable
	set input non-undoable

This is *not* a way to suppress the UNDO command! When you set input undoable, you're telling the parser that the player *can* perform an UNDO command (whether by typing "UNDO" or some other way) and therefore this is a turn that should be added to the undo chain. If you set input non-undoable, you're telling the parser that future UNDO commands should skip over this command.

To make this more clear: when the player does an UNDO, they don't want to jump back to the previous *input*; they want to jump back to the previous *turn*. Yes-or-no commands are inputs but never turns. When the setting-up-input rulebook is called, it's *usually* a turn, but you might want to decide otherwise.

We'd better mention how to display hyperlinks in your game text. A hyperlink can contain a number or an object reference. (Or, really, any value that can be cast to an I6 integer, which is any value at all. But stick with the easy cases.) (It's best not to mix numbers and objects in the same game. Pick one.)

	say hyperlink (O - object)
	say hyperlink (N - number)
	say /hyperlink

Use these phrases in text as markup:

	say "You see a [hyperlink sword]ancient elvish sword[/hyperlink]."

Section: Prompt displaying rules

This rulebook displays a prompt before input. It applies to all input contexts.

The default for keystroke input is no prompt. For yes-no input it is ">", unless you've specified prompts by invoking the "player consents asking..." phrase. For the final question, the prompt is "> [run paragraph on]" (as defined by the old print the final prompt rule).

For other cases, including all command contexts, the prompt is ">". You can customize this by changing the old command prompt global variable, or by writing a rule:

	Prompt displaying rule for a command input-context: ...

(See example: "Changing the Prompt".)

Section: Accepting input rules

This rulebook decides whether to accept or reject an incoming event, or convert the event to a different event. It applies to all input contexts.

This is the fussiest rulebook in UGI. It's also the one you will use least often! For many games, the default rules are all you need. So don't be overwhelmed by the description here.

Every time an event arrives, this rulebook is invoked. You can get the event type with this phrase:

	the current input event type -- g-event

So you can write a rule like:

	Handling input rule when the current input event type is hyperlink-event:

Or, as a handy shortcut:

	Handling input rule when handling hyperlink-event:

Depending on the current event type, you can check its contents with one of these phrases:

	the current input event character -- Unicode character
	the current input event hyperlink number -- number
	the current input event hyperlink object -- object
	the current input event line text -- text
	the current input event line word count -- number

An important note: in the accepting input rulebook, the "player's command" snippet has not yet been set up. You cannot refer to this or any other snippet variable; you will get errors. Use the "current input event line text" phrase.

The job of the accepting input rulebook is to reject the event (keep waiting) or accept it (stop waiting and allow event to be processed). These are available as phrases (really just aliases for "rule succeeds" and "rule fails"):

	accept the input event
	reject the input event

The default rules accept character, line, and hyperlink events (assuming they were requested by the setting up input rules). Other event types are rejected by default, although a rearrange event will trigger a status-line refresh first.

You can also convert the event to a different one:

	replace the current input event with the line (T - text)
	replace the current input event with the character (C - Unicode character)
	replace the current input event with the hyperlink object (O - object)
	replace the current input event with the hyperlink number (N - number)

This is handy for simple cases -- perhaps you want to convert hyperlink clicks into a line of text and run that through the parser in the usual way. (See example: "Maze of Keys".) However, it's cleaner to handle hyperlinks in the handling input rulebook. See next section.

Here's the messy part. If you've requested character or line input, and a *different* input event arrives, the character or line input is still in progress. *You may not print text as long as character or line input is in progress.*

To be clear, this is not a problem when you *receive* a character or line event. That signals that the input is complete and printing is safe. But if you get another event type (say a timer or hyperlink event) while char/line input is in progress, you must either

(a) take background action that does not print to the story window, or

(b) accept the event, printing nothing, or

(c) interrupt text input before printing.

The standard redraw status line on arrange rule is an example of policy (a). It redraws the status line (and then rejects the event to continue waiting). See example: "Tick Tick Tick Button".

Policy (b) is fine if you plan to handle the event in the handling input rulebook. See next section.

For policy (c), you'll have to call this phrase:

	interrupt text input for (W - glk-window)

This stops line or character input. If you then reject the event, input will be re-requested automatically.

	interrupt text input for (W - glk-window), preserving input

This variation stores the player's in-progress input as the preload-input-text property of the story-window. The next time line input starts, the string will be pre-loaded into the input buffer. (See example: "Master Blaster".)

The interrupt text input phrase has an additional use: it tells UGI that you're about to print text, so the prompt might have to be redisplayed. This is sometimes helpful if you're rejecting an input event with an error message (rather than silently).

Finally, I'll say again: this is the least commonly used of the five rulebooks! Forget the mess above and read on.

Section: Checking undo input rules



Section: Handling input rules

At this point an input event has been accepted. This rulebook decides how to convert it into an action.

This rulebook applies only to the command contexts (primary and disambiguation). Other questions (yes-or-no, keystroke-wait, etc) do their own setup.

The phrases mentioned above, for examining the input event, still apply:

	the current input event type -- g-event
	if handling (G - g-event): ...
	the current input event character -- Unicode character
	the current input event hyperlink number -- number
	the current input event hyperlink object -- object
	the current input event line text -- text
	the current input event line word count -- number
	accept the input event
	reject the input event

If your rule rejects the event, the command does nothing. The game prompts for another command.

If your rule accepts the event, it is processed. Line input is parsed in the classic way. Any other input type causes an "I beg your pardon?" error.

So what do we do with other input types? Usually you'll invoke this phrase:

	handle the current input event as (act - stored action)

This bypasses the parser entirely. The game will proceed as if the given action had been parsed; the player will carry it out (or try to). For example, if you had a hyperlink labelled "INVENTORY", you might write:

	Handling input rule when handling hyperlink-event:
		handle the current input event as the action of taking inventory;
		accept the input event.

(Note that a stored action is always phrased "the action of...".)

See example: "A Study In Memoriam".

By the way, at the handling-input stage, all inputs have been completed or cancelled. You don't have to worry about manually interrupting text input.

Section: Which rulebook again?

The accepting-input and handling-input rulebooks both operate on input events. They both can accept and reject events. When you're building a game, you may find yourself unsure which to use.

The rules of thumb:

- If you want to generate an action, use a handling input rule.

- If you want to convert some event into a line input event, you can use either, but handling input will probably be simpler.

- If you want to respond to an event without interrupting the player's input, use an accepting input rule.

- If you want to reject an event without even printing a new prompt, use an accepting input rule.

- If you want to respond to events in every input context (including yes-or-no, keystroke-wait, etc) use an accepting input rule.

Section: What about the reading a command activity?

The old "reading a command" activity still exists under UGI. It's called by the same code that runs the handling input rulebook. It's not the same thing, though; we must be careful of the differences.

- Reading a command is an activity. You can write before rules and after rules for it. The accepting input and handling input rulebooks run "inside" reading a command -- between the before and after stages of the activity.

- In an after reading a command rule, you can refer to (or replace) the "player's command" snippet. That's not allowed in a handling input rule; the player's command is not yet set up during that rulebook.

- In a handling input rule, you can say "handle the current input event as the action of...". That's not available at after reading a command time.

- For a disambiguation input, the handling input rule sees what the player typed. In contrast, the player's command (in an after reading a command rule) is the *entire* disambiguated command! An example:

	>GET
	(handling input: text="GET".)
	(after reading: player's command="GET".)
	What do you want to get?
	>RED ROCK
	(handling input: text="RED ROCK".)
	(after reading: player's command="GET RED ROCK".)
	Taken.

In short, the reading a command activity is the most sensible place to examine or replace text. The handling input rulebook is primarily meant for translating *non-textual* input events into actions.

Chapter: The flow of the machinery

It may be helpful to diagram the whole input machine and describe exactly when each rulebook runs.

	(top of parser loop:)
	do before reading a command activity
	repeat until a command is accepted:
		...
		(ParserInput function:)
		repeat until an event is accepted:
			follow setting up input rules
			...
			(AwaitInput function:)
			repeat until an event is accepted:
				follow prompt displaying rules
				redraw the status line
				make all necessary Glk input requests
				wait for an input event to arrive
				follow the accepting input rules
			cancel any remaining Glk input requests
			(end of AwaitInput function)
			...
			reject blank lines ("I beg your pardon")
			if the setting-up rules said that this is an undoable turn:
				follow checking undo input rules
				if the input was an UNDO command:
					perform UNDO
				save an undo point
		(end of ParserInput function)
		...
		follow handling input rules
	(at this point, the "player's command" is set)
	do after reading a command activity
	if no action is recognized, say "I beg your pardon"
	otherwise, carry out the action	

Requests such as "player consents" and "wait for any key" only invoke the AwaitInput function. They bypass ParserInput, and thus ignore the setting up input rules and the handling input rules.

The inner blank-line rejection is a bit of an anomaly. It happens before the handling input rules (and the after reading a command activity), which may cause problems; you cannot handle blank line input the same way you handle other line input.

UGI offers a use option to resolve this:

	Use pass blank input lines.

If you set this, the reject blank lines step is omitted. A blank line will pass through all the same rulebooks as other line input. It will be rejected at the *last* step -- no action is recognized, say "I beg your pardon". So the player will see the same response, really.

(One difference: we will have passed through the save-undo step. That is, when this option is set, blank lines count as undoable commands. That's not great, but it's not a big nuisance either. A future version of UGI may address this.)

Chapter: Low-level invocations

UGI offers phrases to stop and wait for a particular input (a keystroke, a yes-or-no question). It's quite easy to write your own such phrase.

Say we want to stop and wait for one hyperlink click. First we'll want to define a new input-context:

	Link-wait context is an input-context.

Then we need a rule to accept hyperlink input, storing the link value in a global:

	The found object is an object that varies.
	Rule for accepting input for link-wait context when handling hyperlink-event:
		now the found object is the current input event hyperlink object;
		accept the input event.

Now we can write a phrase:

	To decide what object is the hyperlink waited for:
		now the found object is nothing;
		clear all input requests;
		now the story-window is hyperlink-input-request;
		await input in link-wait context;
		decide on the found object.

The core phrase here is

	await input in (C - input-context)

Before calling this, we *must* set the desired request properties. (Remember, the setting up input rulebook will not be run) It is best to clear all requests and then set exactly the requests desired.

If we want line input, we must use one of the alternate forms:

	await input in (C - input-context) with primary buffer
	await input in (C - input-context) with secondary buffer

Generally you will want to use the secondary buffer. That will avoid stomping on the player's command (which is always stored in the primary buffer).

For another case, see example: "Secret Number Request"

Chapter: Under the hood

This chapter describes what UGI has changed in the deep reaches of the Parser.i6t template. It is not very interesting.

The low-level functions VM_ReadKeyboard and VM_KeyDelay are gone. Instead, AwaitInput handles the bottom-level glk_select loop. Where VM_ReadKeyboard took two arguments (buffer and table), AwaitInput takes four (input-context, event, buffer, table).

Responsibility for redrawing the status line and printing the prompt has been moved into AwaitInput. (In the old model, these had to be done before calling an input function, meaning they were required in a lot of places. Bugs resulted.)

The old Keyboard routine has been renamed ParserInput. It too now takes input-context, event, buffer, and table arguments. ParserInput is a wrapper around AwaitInput which adds OOPS and UNDO support.

Blank line rejection is still handled in ParserInput (nee Keyboard), but only for the sake of backwards compatibility. By using the "pass blank input lines" option, the game can omit this check from ParserInput. Blank lines are then handled the same way as all other line input (and rejected by the parser at a later stage).

TestKeyboardPrimitive (in Tests.i6t) is now named CheckTestInput. It now takes event and buffer arguments. (Not table, as tokenization is now handled by the caller.) 

Responsibility for getting TEST ME input (the CheckTestInput call) has been moved into AwaitInput, right next to the code that gets REPLAY stream input. CheckTestInput returns a flag indicating whether it generated a test event. (This is different from TestKeyboardPrimitive, which was called from the KeyboardPrimitive wrapper, and called through to VM_ReadKeyboard when no test event was available. KeyboardPrimitive is not needed in the new model.)

The parser itself used to call Keyboard in three places (Parser Letter A and NounDomain). It now calls ParserInput, and understands that it could receive any kind of input event (not just line input). 

The parser invokes the handling input rulebook after each ParserInput call. If that rulebook generates an action, Parser__parse returns immediately (or NounDomain returns REPARSE_CODE, which leads to the same outcome.) Then the parser rejects blank lines and non-text inputs with an "I beg your pardon" error. After that, we know we have non-blank text input, so parsing proceeds in the original path.


Example: * Changing the Prompt - Changing the command prompt in various contexts.

The old "command prompt" global variable still works, but we'd like a more rule-based approach. Here we use "What now?" for the command prompt (both primary and disambiguation) and "Answer now!" for the final question.

We also use an extended form of the "player consents" phrase, in which we supply the prompt question to use.

	*: "Changing the Prompt"
	
	Include Unified Glulx Input by Andrew Plotkin.

	Prompt displaying rule for a command input-context:
		instead say "What now? ".

	Prompt displaying rule for the final question context:
		instead say "Answer now! ".

	The Kitchen is a room. "You are in a kitchen."
	The Outdoors is outside from the Kitchen.

	Check going outside:
		if the player consents asking "Outdoors is scary. Are you sure?" and "That was a yes/no question.":
			instead end the story finally;
		else:
			instead say "You fail to overcome your agoraphobia.";

	Test me with "out / maybe / no / out / yes".


Example: ** Tick Tick Tick Button - A timer in the status window.

This timer updates a clock in the status window. It never interrupts input or writes to the story window, so we only need an accepting input rule. The rule does its work and then rejects the event. (Timer events are rejected by default, so that last line isn't necessary, but it keeps the flow clear.)

The rule doesn't specify an input-context; timer input operates in all contexts. Thus, the clock keeps running during the yes-or-no question. It would keep running even during the game's final question if we didn't switch it off.

	A button is scenery in the Lounge.

	Check pushing the button:
		if the player consents asking "Are you very very sure?":
			say "[line break]It is now [readout]. The experiment [one of]succeeds[or]fails[purely at random].";
			set the timer off;
			instead end the story finally;

Example: *** Master Blaster - A timer that triggers a game action.

In this game, the BLAST command causes an explosion exactly two seconds later.

We want the timer to interrupt player input, so we accept the timer event. The interrupt text input line is not required; UGI always interrupts all input when an event is accepted. But by invoking it explicitly with the "preserving input" option, we ensure that the player's interrupted command will be preloaded into the next input line. It also allows us to print a quick "Interrupting..." message before the rule finishes.

Note that we only accept timer events when in a command input-context. In any other context (yes-or-no, etc) we would want to ignore the event -- it wouldn't make sense to trigger one game action in the middle of another. (In fact, the handling input rules don't even run in non-command contexts, so the event would be wasted anyhow.)

Once the timer event is accepted, it proceeds to the next rulebook, the handling input rules. The rule here generates an explosioning action. (This is a special action which has no understand lines. It cannot be invoked directly by the player; the handling input rule is the only way the explosioning can occur.)

	Include Unified Glulx Input by Andrew Plotkin.

	The Repository is a room. "You are in an immense room, even larger than the giant room. A sign reads, 'Say BLAST to wrap it all up!'"

	The gap is a thing. "A ragged gap in the south wall shows the way to victory!" 

	Check entering the gap:
		say "You march through in triumph.";
		turn the timer off;
		instead end the story finally.

	Check going south in the Repository:
		if the gap is in the Repository:
			instead try entering the gap.

	Blasting is an action applying to nothing.

	Understand "blast" as blasting.

	Carry out blasting:
		if the timer is active:
			instead say "The explosion is already on its way.";
		set the timer to 2 seconds;
		say "You say the magic word. The air prickles. Wait for it..."

	Check answering someone that "blast":
		instead try blasting.

	Explosioning is an action applying to nothing.

	Carry out explosioning:
		if the gap is not in the Repository:
			now the gap is in the Repository;
			now the gap is fixed in place;
			instead say "A tremendous explosion rocks the Repository! When the dust clears, you see a gap to the south.";
		say "Additional fireworks go off! No new gaps though."	

	Rule for accepting input for a command input-context when handling timer-event:
		interrupt text input for the story-window, preserving input;
		say "(Interrupting...)";
		accept input event.

	Rule for handling input for a command input-context when handling timer-event:
		turn the timer off;
		handle the current input event as the action of explosioning.


Example: ** Maze of Keys - Controlling the game with single keystrokes.

In this example, the underworld uses a different input mechanism: single keystrokes. Character events are translated into line input for the parser. (This is a crude approach. See the "Maze of Keys 2" example for a tidier model.)

Example: *** Maze of Keys 2 - Controlling the game with single keystrokes.

This is nearly the same as the previous example. But now, instead of changing char input events to line input events, we handle char events directly as going actions.

The work is now done in the accepting input rulebook. We no longer pretend that we're entering line input, and the parser is entirely bypassed.

Example: ** A Study In Memoriam - A pure-hyperlink game.

Here we drop text input entirely. (Dropping the standard parser input line request rule accomplishes this.) Instead we set up input to be hyperlink-based. Hyperlink events are translated into the examining action, which happily works for both on-stage objects and off-stage memories.

	The antique shop is a memory. The description is "You discovered a mad antique shop on a years-ago trip to North Carolina.

Example: **** Secret Number Request - A phrase to query the player for a number.

In this example we ask the player for a number. It's very much like "if the player consents..." except that we get back a number rather than a yes-or-no decision.

We'll want a new input-context for this operation, so we invent one: numeric context. Our prompt displaying rule relies on this to give the player a special prompt for the number-typing operation.

The "number waited for" phrase demonstrates doing a low-level input operation. First we must clear all input requests for the story window. (We don't want a request left over from regular command input.) Then we set the input request we want -- line input only. Then we "await input", using our special numeric context.

Then it gets a little bit messy. There's no easy I7 access to the input buffer. We can't use "the player's command" because that's a parser variable. We're doing this behind the parser's back, so no player's command is ever set. Nor can we match against an I7 token like "[number]".

Instead, we rely on an existing I6 function called TryNumber. This returns the parsed number, or -1000 if no number was typed. Loop until we get something valid.

Unfortunately, TryNumber is set up to use the parser's input buffer. That's why the input phrase is

	await input in numeric context with primary buffer;

This winds up stomping on "the player's command"; that snippet will be invalid for the rest of the turn. Too bad! (Really, "if the player consents" has the same bug.)

A better implementation would rely on the secondary buffer. We couldn't use TryNumber, though, so it would be a longer and messier example.
